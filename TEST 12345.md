# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project is based on Louis’s play Fever which came close to its fundraising goal in a short period of time. Louise now wants an analysis of how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. The analysis will consist of visualizations to show campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to determine for Louise the best window for launching a theater fundraising campaign for a play and to set an achievable fundraising goal based on the dataset that was provided.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To determine the best window for launching a theater fundraising campaign is to sum the outcomes throughout the months of the year. In doing so the numbers show that May & June would be the most successful time to launch a fundraising campaign. May saw the most successful fundraising campaigns with 111 and just 52 failed, while June also had a great month with 100 successful and only 49 failed. 

When you refer to the line chart below the month of December may stand out as the worst month to launch a fundraising campaign due to the lowest all-time campaigns conducted, successful, and failed.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Campaigns require donations from backers to be pledged towards the goal in order to determine the rate of success a campaign had. Based on the analysis campaign goals that are less than $20,000 have an estimated 50% chance of being successful. This point also show’s that the lower the goal the higher rate of success, and the higher the goal the higher rate of failure.

The chart below was created to visualize the outcomes by goal in the subcategory of theater plays. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The format of all the dates in the dataset were written in the UNIX timestamp format which required identifying and solving for them with a formula to convert the UNIX timestamp to a readable date. By doing this we were able to determine length of campaign and extra year of campaign. 

Another dataset that required some work was identifying the category and subcategory which was merged in one column and required the use of “Text to Columns” feature to isolate each into their own columns.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

To conclude my findings from the analysis of theater outcomes by launch date we determined May and June as the best months to launch a campaign, whereas December would be the ultimate worst month based on the data provided. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

To conclude my findings from the analysis of outcomes based on goals a lower goal of $5000-$10,000 would bring the best possible success rate for Louise.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The limitations of this dataset include time frame of the data provided could have been more up to date. Also, I believe that some of the data maybe skewed due to economic data that may have been faced during some of these campaigns such as inflation, geographic economic conditions, and demographics.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

An additional analysis that would go hand in hand with launch date would include the length of the campaign to determine the success rate of the length of time a campaign is held. In addition, some campaigns that were held during the winter months which showed not to be successful may have weather to be a factor that should be considered, so isolating countries and trying to determine how the weather may have affected the success rate would be a table worth analyzing.
